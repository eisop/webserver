# CheckerPrinter

A Java package to check a given Java program using the Checker Framework and
format the results.

This package is based on the traceprinter package from java_jail:
https://github.com/daveagp/java_jail with GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3. Modified by Charles Chen (charleszhuochen@gmail.com) Mar 2016.

## Major modifications

1. Remove traceprinter.VMCommander, traceprinter.shoelace, and
traceprinter.JSONTracingThread because we do not need to execute the user code.

2. Remove unused methods in traceprinter.JDI2JSON.

3. Change traceprinter.JDI2JSON to checkerprinter.CHECKER2JSON, adapt the JSON
format to the frontend of the Checker Framework webserver.

4. Modified InMemory.java:
	1. add initCheckerArgs to initialize checker arguments.
	2. add printCheckerReport to print checker result in JSON format.
  3. modified InMemory constructor: add JSR308 field to store JSR308 environment
     variable. (JSR308 will be passed as command line argument to InMemory, e.g
     java -cp ... InMemory $JSR308).
  4. add checkerMap to store mapping of frontend parameter to real checker.

This project would not be possible without the package
com.sun.tools.example.trace, written by Robert Field. 
http://www.docjar.com/docs/api/com/sun/tools/example/trace/package-index.html
The traceprinter package was initially created from that package.

NEWS

A big update on June 11 2013 makes everything compile and execute in memory,
so no writing to the file system is needed, and no considerations for
simultaneous users are necessary.

===
WHAT DOES THIS PACKAGE DO AND WHAT DOES IT CONTAIN?

traceprinter.InMemory: the main class. It takes java file source code 
                       from standard input. Then it outputs a text (JSON)
                       version of what the program didwhen executed.

The output format is described here:
  https://github.com/pgbovine/OnlinePythonTutor/blob/master/v3/docs/opt-trace-format.md
This allows us to use the javascript frontend from OnlinePythonTutor
to visualize Java instead of Python. 

traceprinter.ramtools: compiles the java files to bytecode in memory.

Then, InMemory uses the JDI to start a debuggee JVM, load the bytecode into
it, and then execute it.

traceprinter.VMCommander: drives injection and execution into debuggee.

traceprinter.shoelace: contains all fixed code run by the debugee JVM.

traceprinter.JSONTracingThread: event handling loop.

traceprinter.JDI2JSON: used to convert everything to text output.
 
===
FLOW OF EXECUTION

InMemory will get things started, and passes the ball briefly to 
JSONTracingThread. But once the debuggee takes it first step, the
VMCommander drives the execution of the debuggee VM. Again, the
code it causes to run, will drive the event loop in JSONTracingThread
some more, which in turn uses JDI2JSON to output things nicely.
