This directory contains wsgi configuration files for the Checker
Framework Live Demo webserver.
Author: Charles Chen

# File description

- checkerweb-wsgi.conf: Apache file for mounting checkweb to apache2
  by wsgi as virtual host. This file needs two dependencies of apache2:
  1) mod_wsgi 2) mod_macro.
  This option makes it easier to configure parameters.

- checkerweb-wsgi-without-macro.conf: this file is similar to
  checkerweb-wsgi.conf except it doesn't use macros. This file only
  depends on mod_wsgi. But it is harder to configure parameters
  because of the unavoidable hard-code-style.

- checkerweb.wsgi: wsgi script of checkerweb.

# Instruction on configuring `checkerweb-wsgi.conf` and `checkerweb-wsgi-without-macro.conf`

## Configure `checkerweb-wsgi.conf`

Generally, you only need to modify the values of four arguments on the line of declaring Use of the macro:

`Use VHost_CheckerWeb $web_name $domain $admin $wsgi_script_alias`

The meaning of above four arguments of this macro:

1. $web_name: the directory name of webserver files, this diretory should under `/var/www`. 
    Also, $web_name would be used as the name of WSGIDaemonProcess and the name of WSGIProcessGroup of this webserver.

2. $domain: the domain name of this server. Currently this argument would also be used as the alias of this server. 

3. $admin: The email address of server administrator.

4. $wsgi_script_alias: URL prefix of this wsgi server, i.e. only the URL with prefix $wsgi_script_alias would be delegated to this server.

## Configure `checkerweb-wsgi-without-macro.conf`

Configuring this file need some basic knowledge of configuring apache2 vhost and wsgi configuration in apache2:
1. configuring apache2 vhost: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/vhosts/
2. wsgi server configuration in apache2: https://modwsgi.readthedocs.org/en/develop/user-guides/quick-configuration-guide.html

Things you might need to configure according to you own server environment:

1. server directory. make sure apache2 has correct right to access this directory.

2. log location. Currently the default location is /var/log/apache2 (which is the default apache2 log location in ubuntu 14.10)

3. wsgi script alias, name of process group and name of daemon process.

4. domain name, server alias, server admin email address.

Note: default we set DocumentRoot to /var/www/html in order to avoid exposing server files.
